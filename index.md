Hello! My alias is ghostway. My hidden talent is to break stuff unintentionally.

I would love to hear from you; my email is at tuta.io. You can also follow my updates on the [Microb(ullshit)log](/microbullshit.html) and/or subscribe via [RSS](/feed.xml).

You can find my keys [here](/keys.txt), and credit card details [here](/cards.html).

[Here](/sources.html) you can find some cool sources I like to link to friends. This is not updated regularly (well, nothing here is).
